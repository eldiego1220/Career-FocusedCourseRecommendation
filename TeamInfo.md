## Project Summary

Finding classes is already a difficult task, especially when coupled with a career search. We aim to make that easier by combining both searches into one convenient service. With a dataset of 2023's LinkedIn job postings, we aim to allow users to filter job postings by multiple criteria - such as location, minimum pay, job title, skills required, etc. - and rank them by company reviews, and with the resulting set of job postings, build a custom class schedule that best supports these jobs. 

We not only facilitate each individual search but help optimize both in a way that they support each other. Through our application, the user will be able to curate a set of courses that will fully prepare them for their desired career, and understand which companies and roles appeal to them the most.
